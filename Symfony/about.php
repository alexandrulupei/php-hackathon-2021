	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>You may have noticed that sports without a healthy lifestyle are like a bicycle without wheels. Well, it just doesn't work. And it's as if you try and are stubborn to have the desired results only through sports, without worrying about what you eat or what habits you have, the later the results are delayed or do not appear at all. From here we deduce how important is the lifestyle you choose to get the dream fitness and achieve your goals! ðŸ˜ƒ

  <p>First of all, when we discuss the lifestyle, we are actually talking about a unitary whole made up of: MIND | BODY | SPIRIT. You may be wondering: "Okay, and what does this have to do with the way I live my life ?!". Find out that every decision and habit ultimately shapes your lifestyle, mind, body and spirit, which is why it is crucial to form healthy habits that will help your health flourish, not the other way around.</p>
